#7 Days of JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a high level, dynamic, interpreted programming language. Along with HTML and CSS, it's one of the three essential technologies used in Web content production. The majority of websites employ JavaScript, and it's supported by all modern web browsers without plugins.

####**Day 1**: Learn basic Input/Output, print "Hello World!", and get started with conditional logic.

####**Day 2**: Introducing variables, arithmetic operators, switch statements, and objects.
* **_Switch Statements_**: The switch statement evaluates an expression, matches the expression's value to a case clause, and executes the statements associated with that particular case (https://youtu.be/Z6O_XdfCBEo)
```javascript
//example switch statement
switch (day) {  //day is an integer varying from 0 to 6.
    case 6:
        text = "Today is Saturday";
        break;
    case 0:
        text = "Today is Sunday";
        break;
    default:
        text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
} 
```

####**Day 6**: Solve simple problems with algorithms, data structures, and recursion.
