/*Task

You are given two number variables a and b. Both of them have been declared and assigned.

Your task is to :

Create a variable add and assign it with the summation of a and b.
Create a variable sub and assign it with the subtraction of b from a.
Create a variable mul and assign it with the multiplication of a and b.
Create a variable div and assign it with the division of a by b.
Create a variable inc and assign it with the incremented value of a.
Create a variable dec and assign it with the decremented value of b.
Note: Do not create variables a and b. They have already been created and assigned inside our code checker.*/

//Do not declare variables `a` and `b`.
//Write your code below this line.

var add = a+b;
var sub = a-b;
var mul = a*b;
var div = a/b;
// var inc = a++; ****here 'a' is assigned first and then incremented.
var inc = ++a; //here 'a' is incremented first and then assigned. 
// add ++ ahead of 'a', if you want to assign inc at the time of if declaration.
var dec = --b;
